JDK8
===

Source code from JDK's src.zip. Can be used for study the evolution of Java.

# How it works

I [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) different versions of JDK from 1.1.x to the recent released 8u162, install or unzip them, commit source code of every src.zip into a different branch in the repository.
